<p align="center"><strong>Spot it. Fix it. Prove it.</strong> Self-hosted, open-source application security that never sends your code anywhere.</p>

Pitangus scans your repositories and container images, tells you **what to fix first and how** (the exact command or a code example), confirms the fix landed and **keeps watching** whatever changes next. Everything runs on your machine with your credentials: your code never reaches any service of ours.

> Status: **beta (v0.12)**. It works and is tested, but the API and the `data/` formats may still change between releases.

## Why Pitangus

- **Self-hosted and free software (AGPL-3.0).** Your code, dependencies and findings stay on your server.
- **One place for everything:** code (SAST), dependencies, secrets, infrastructure as code, pipelines and images, with seven open-source engines and no duplicates across them.
- **From finding to verified fix:** real prioritization (CISA KEV and EPSS), a fix command for each package manager, a **Verify again** button, and automatic remediation once a finding stops showing up.
- **Built for small teams, in English and Spanish**, with evidence ready for SOC 2 and ISO 27001 audits and threat modeling tied to your actual findings.

## What it does

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Find** | Opengrep with 58 Pitangus rules (JS/TS, Python, Java, Go, PHP, Ruby, C#), Gitleaks, Trivy and OSV-Scanner for dependencies, Checkov and zizmor for IaC and GitHub Actions, Trivy + Grype for images. Your code is never executed. One repository or many, a whole organization, or several images at once. |
| **Prioritize** | Every advisory is checked against CISA KEV (active exploitation) and EPSS (exploit probability); dependencies are grouped by package, with the version that closes all of their advisories. |
| **Fix** | Each finding tells you how to fix it: the command for your package manager (npm, pip, Poetry, Go, Cargo, Maven…), the override when it's transitive, a before/after example for code, or the steps to rotate a secret. Export to Jira without duplicates. |
| **Verify** | **Verify again** rescans and tells you "Fixed ✓" or "Still present". On pull requests only what the PR introduces counts, with a comment and a status check that can block the merge. |
| **Watch** | Automatic rescans when the main branch changes, a daily offline check of new advisories against your dependencies, and messages to **Slack, Teams or a webhook** when something important shows up. |
| **Prove** | Technical and evidence PDF reports (SOC 2 Type II, ISO/IEC 27001:2022, organization roll-up), SARIF, JSON and Markdown; threat modeling (STRIDE, LINDDUN, PASTA, attack trees, ATT&CK) with a diagram; a local CVE tracker built from NVD. |

**In development** (grayed out in the panel): dynamic testing (DAST), GitLab/Bitbucket/Azure DevOps (covered today by [`scan` in CI](docs/cli.md)) and optional AI assistance.

## Try it in 5 minutes

You need **Docker** (Engine 24+ with Compose v2.24+), **make** and **git**, 4 GB of memory and 8 GB of disk. `make doctor` checks all of it.

```bash
git clone --branch v0.12.1 https://github.com/Pitangus-Dev/pitangus.git
cd pitangus
make setup PREBUILT=1
make up
make demo
```

`make setup PREBUILT=1` uses the published, signed images, still only on this machine; `make up` pulls them and the
engines, starts everything and prints the URL and the **setup code**. Measured on a clean machine: under a minute plus
about 800 MB of downloads (some 2 minutes at 50 Mbps; behind a corporate VPN it can take much longer, see
[troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)). Leave out `make setup PREBUILT=1` to build the images from the
code instead. `make demo` runs a real scan of the intentionally vulnerable examples shipped with the repository and imports a threat model, so you can see Pitangus at work without connecting anything (`make demo IMAGE=nginx:1.21` adds an image).

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8766>, create the admin account with the code and follow **Getting started** on the Overview. The full walkthrough, including what's optional: [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md).

The panel follows your browser's language and has a language switch in the sidebar and on the sign-in screen. PR comments, notifications, Jira issues, reports and CLI output use `PITANGUS_DEFAULT_LOCALE` (`en` or `es`, default `en`).

## Security in brief

- Secrets (GitHub App key, Jira token, TOTP seeds) are **encrypted with AES-256-GCM** in the database, with a master key kept apart from it. A database dump alone reveals nothing. They never go back to the browser and never show up in logs.
- The GitHub App needs only four permissions (`contents: read`, `metadata: read`, `pull_requests: write`, `statuses: write`), with no webhooks or OAuth; one-hour tokens kept in memory. For several organizations, set it to **Any account** and connect each installation explicitly in the panel.
- The panel listens on `127.0.0.1` by default. If you expose it beyond your machine without **HTTPS**, the server refuses to start.
- Private registry credentials are encrypted and handed to the engines through environment variables; registries on internal networks are blocked unless you explicitly allow them.
- No telemetry. Advisory databases are downloaded and queried locally; your dependency list only goes to OSV if you allow it for a scan. Alerts only go to the channels you configure.
- **Trade-off** on a laptop: the worker launches the engines through the Docker socket, which is equivalent to root on the host. On a server (`make setup DOMAIN=…`, `deploy/compose.yaml`) the worker runs them inside its own image, with no socket.

To report a vulnerability: [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md).

## Run it on a server (HTTPS)

Pitangus runs wherever a container does. [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) covers every target: a single compose file for any server or Docker panel (Coolify, Dokploy, Portainer, Hostinger), plus Render, Railway and Vercel for the API (untested). Its worker can run the engines inside its own image, so no target needs the host's Docker socket.

On your own VPS with this repository, with the DNS record pointing at the server:

```bash
make setup DOMAIN=appsec.your-domain.com   # Caddy with automatic HTTPS
make up
```

This builds the images on the server; `make setup DOMAIN=… PREBUILT=1` runs the published, signed images instead.

The API is then reachable only through Caddy, HTTP redirects to HTTPS and the certificate renews itself. The guide covers sizing, OS and firewall, backups offsite and restore, upgrades, Prometheus metrics, and Coolify and Dokploy: [docs/deploy-vps.md](docs/deploy-vps.md).
