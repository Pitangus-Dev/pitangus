"""Relations that can't be foreign keys (see migration 0003), checked on demand by `pitangus doctor`. They span the
runs and findings contexts, so the check lives in the composition layer.

Only a repository purge deletes runs, and it also deletes the repository's registry and triage. A registry asset or a
triage decision whose repository has no run left is what an interrupted purge leaves behind: `fix` deletes it. A
finished run missing from the registry is only reported: rebuilding it from runs would lose what doesn't come from a
run (closed PRs, exclusions), and the repository's next full analysis restores it.
