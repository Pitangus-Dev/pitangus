"""Findings registry per repository: the current state and its lifecycle.

A run is a snapshot; the registry is the film. Each finding (by its stable fingerprint)
lives here with its origin, when it was first and last seen, and whether it is still
open. It is updated only when a run finishes:

* **Full scan** (main branch): what shows up stays open (and reopens if it had been
  fixed); what was open from the main branch and no longer shows up is **fixed
  automatically**. Only if the scan finished entirely: in an **incomplete** one (an
  engine didn't run, truncated snapshot) not showing up proves nothing, so it opens and
  updates but never fixes. Nor does a complete one fix a finding that only engines which
  failed in it see (an optional engine such as Checkov or zizmor can fail without making
  the scan incomplete): they didn't look, so its absence proves nothing either.
* **Excluded paths** (`exclusions`): whatever falls under them is **excluded**, neither open
  nor fixed. If the path stops being excluded, the next scan reopens it.
* **Secrets withheld by the secret detection settings** (allowlist, disabled rule): excluded with the reason, never
  fixed. They reopen when the settings stop withholding them, and are fixed only once a complete scan no longer
  sees them even without the filters.
* **PR review**: what the PR introduces stays open with origin "PR #n"; what that same
  PR had introduced and is no longer in its new commit is fixed. A PR closed without
  merging withdraws its findings; a merged one leaves them waiting for the next full
  scan, which confirms whether they reached the main branch.
* **Imports** (`sarif_import`, findings from another tool): what shows up opens with origin
  "import" and the tool's name. Only a later complete import of the **same tool** with scope
  "full" fixes what that tool no longer reports; a partial import (some files, one module) only
  opens and updates. Pitangus's own scans and PR reviews never fix an imported finding, nor
  does an import fix theirs: each tool vouches only for what it looks at.

Manual remediation is a triage decision with a mandatory justification; if the finding
reappears in a later run, it reopens on its own.
