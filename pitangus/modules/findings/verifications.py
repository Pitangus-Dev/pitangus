"""Re-verify a finding: scan its asset again and tell whether it is still there.

Closes the find → fix → verify loop without searching a new scan by hand. It stores which finding asked
for verification and with which run (`data/verifications.json`); the result is derived from the findings
registry when that run finishes:

- `running`: the scan is queued or in progress.
- `fixed`: the full scan no longer finds it (the registry marked it remediated).
- `present`: it still shows up.
- `inconclusive`: the scan was incomplete (an engine didn't run): it proves nothing, as in the registry.
- `failed`: the scan failed.

If a scan of that asset is already queued or running (another verification, the branch watch), the
finding joins it instead of starting another one.
