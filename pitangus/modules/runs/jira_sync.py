"""Findings to Jira issues: manual exports, automatic creation, backfills and the comments on fix and reopen.

* **Routing.** Each finding goes where the first matching rule of its asset says (`integrations/jira_routing.py`), so
  one export may create issues in several projects. No enabled rule: the finding fails with "no destination".
* **One issue per remediation job.** Advisories of one installed package go together; code and secrets, one by one.
* **Idempotent.** Before creating, the stored link (`findings/tickets.py`) and the issue's identity label (`jira.identity_label`; JQL in
  the destination's project) are checked; exporting or delivering twice doesn't duplicate.
* **Automatic creation.** When a run adds new open findings to the registry, a rule in `auto` mode matching the asset
  queues their creation in the outbox (channel `jira`) for the findings at or above its minimum severity. Runs that
  do: full scans, SARIF imports and the advisory watch (a new advisory against the main branch's dependencies is new
  work on what is deployed, and no scan would bring it sooner). PR reviews don't: the PR comment is their channel, and
  their findings reach the registry's main-branch state only through the next full scan. Findings dismissed in triage
  (false positive, accepted risk, fixed by hand) or excluded are skipped, when queued and again when delivered.
* **Backfill.** Saving or enabling an automatic rule with backfill queues the open findings of its assets that have no
  issue yet, spaced out (Jira's rate limits) and counted per rule (`jira-backfill`).
* **Fix and reopen.** When a full scan or a full import verifies as fixed the findings of a linked issue, Pitangus
  comments on it (never closes it). An issue covering several findings gets the comment when all of them are fixed:
  it is one remediation job (one upgrade), and a comment per finding would be noise. If any of them reappears later,
  it comments that too. Comments speak PITANGUS_DEFAULT_LOCALE, like everything the team reads.
* **Delivery** is the worker's (`drain`): at least once, with the outbox's retries; Jira being down or throttling
  (429, 5xx) is retried, a request Jira rejects (4xx) fails and says why.
