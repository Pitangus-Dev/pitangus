# Containers and Makefile

All of Pitangus runs in Docker. The `Makefile` at the repository root wraps the `docker compose` commands so that starting, upgrading or backing up is a single command.

## What you need

| Tool | Version | How to install it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker Engine | 24 or later | [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev) (macOS) or `docker-ce` on Linux |
| Docker Compose | v2.24 or later | Included with Docker Desktop and OrbStack; on Linux, the `docker-compose-plugin` package |
| make | any version (including macOS's 3.81) | macOS: already there (or `xcode-select --install`) · Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install make` · Fedora: `sudo dnf install make` · Windows: inside WSL2 |
| git | any version | To clone and for `make update` |

You **don't** need Python or Node to use it, only to develop it (`make dev-setup`).

`make doctor` checks all of this and tells you how to fix anything missing.

## Start it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pitangus-Dev/pitangus.git
cd pitangus
make up
```

`make up`:

1. creates `.env` from `.env.example` with your UID/GID (if it doesn't exist yet) and the `data/` and `config/` folders;
2. builds the images if they changed;
3. starts everything and waits until the panel responds;
4. pulls any missing engine images, with progress (the first time can take a while depending on your connection; after that it downloads nothing);
5. prints the URL and, if there's no admin yet, the **setup code**.

It works the same on macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Linux, and Windows with WSL or Git Bash. On Linux, and on WSL with native Docker, the Docker socket belongs to the `docker` group: `make` detects its GID and passes it to the container (`DOCKER_SOCKET_GID`). If you start with `docker compose` directly on those machines, set that value in `.env` (`stat -Lc %g /var/run/docker.sock`).

## Command reference

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make help` | Lists the commands. |
| `make doctor` | Checks Docker, Compose, architecture, disk, port, permissions on `data/` and `config/`, and the engines. |
| `make setup` | Only creates `.env` and the folders; never touches an existing `.env`. `make setup PREBUILT=1` runs the published images instead of building them. On a server, `make setup DOMAIN=pitangus.example.com [PREBUILT=1]` switches it to HTTPS with Caddy (and the published images): see [deploy-vps.md](deploy-vps.md). |
| `make build` | Builds the app and Opengrep images. |
| `make up` | Builds if needed, starts, pulls any missing engines and prints the URL and setup code. |
| `make demo` | Scans the repository's vulnerable examples and imports a threat model, so you can try it without connecting anything. `IMAGE=nginx:1.21` adds an image. |
| `make down` | Stops and removes the containers. `data/` and `config/` are kept. |
| `make restart` | Restarts the app. Running scans are marked as failed. |
| `make status` | State of the containers and the engine images. |
| `make logs` | Follows the app's logs; `SERVICE=worker`, `caddy` or `backup` for another service. |
| `make setup-code` | Prints the setup code again. |
| `make scan` | Scans a local folder: `make scan DIR=../my-repo ARGS="--base main"`. See [cli.md](cli.md). |
| `make engines` | Pulls, from the host and with progress, any missing Trivy, OSV-Scanner, Gitleaks, Grype, Checkov and zizmor images. `make up` already does this; use it to retry after a network failure. |
| `make update` | Takes a backup, `git pull` (on a branch), pulls the published images if you use them, and restarts on the new version (the database migrates on start). |
| `make backup` | Dumps the database and copies `data/` and `config/` into `backups/<date>/`. Refuses to run while scans are in progress (unless `FORCE=1`). |
| `make restore FROM=backups/<date> CONFIRM=restore` | Restores a backup (database, `config/`, `data/`) after saving the current state in `backups/pre-restore-<date>/`. Then `make up`. |
| `make verify-images` | Checks the cosign signatures of the published images (`PITANGUS_IMAGE`). |
| `make shell` | Shell inside the container. |
| `make cli ARGS="…"` | The app's CLI, e.g. `make cli ARGS="user list"` or `make cli ARGS="user reset-totp --username ana"`. |
| `make clean` | Stops everything and removes Pitangus's images. |
| `make purge CONFIRM=delete` | **Deletes `data/` and `config/`**: runs, users and secrets. |
| `make dev-setup` · `make dev` | Development environment without containers (see [development.md](development.md)). |
| `make test` · `make lint` · `make check` | Backend tests, panel lint, and both. |
| `make standalone` | Regenerates `deploy/compose.yaml`, the one-file deployment ([deploy.md](deploy.md)). |

Without `make`, the same with Compose: `sh scripts/init-env.sh && docker compose up --build -d`.

## Images

| Image | Source | Approx. size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `localhost/pitangus/app:<version>` | Built from `docker/app/Dockerfile` (Node only in the build stage) | 360 MB |
| `worker-standalone` target | `docker/app/Dockerfile`: the app plus every engine, copied by digest from the images below (Checkov installed with pip) | 1.8 GB |
| `localhost/pitangus/opengrep:1.30.0` | Built from `docker/engines/opengrep/` | 230 MB |
| `aquasec/trivy` | Docker Hub, pinned by digest | 240 MB |
| `ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks` | GHCR, pinned by digest | 80 MB |
| `anchore/grype` | Docker Hub, pinned by digest; container images only | 110 MB (+2.1 GB database) |
| `bridgecrew/checkov` | Docker Hub, pinned by digest | 200 MB |
| `ghcr.io/zizmorcore/zizmor` | GHCR, pinned by digest | 15 MB |
| `caddy` | Docker Hub, pinned by digest; only with `compose.prod.yaml` | 50 MB |

**Published images.** Each version tag builds `ghcr.io/pitangus-dev/pitangus:<version>`, `ghcr.io/pitangus-dev/pitangus-worker:<version>` (engines inside) and `ghcr.io/pitangus-dev/pitangus-opengrep:<engine version>` for amd64 and arm64, with an SBOM and SLSA provenance, signed with cosign keyless (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). `compose.images.yaml` runs them instead of building; `make verify-images` checks the signatures. Every engine image used has an arm64 variant too.

The base images (`node`, `python`, `debian`) are pinned by digest, so two builds of the same version use exactly the same layers. The app image's OCI labels declare the version, license and repository (`docker inspect pitangus`).

## App container hardening

| Measure | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Unprivileged user with your UID/GID | Files in `data/` and `config/` are yours; the process isn't root. |
| `read_only: true` | It can't modify its own code or the system: it only writes to `/data`, `/config` and in-memory temp dirs (`/tmp`, `$HOME`). |
| `cap_drop: [ALL]` and `no-new-privileges` | No Linux capabilities and no way to gain them. |
| `init: true` | Reaps orphan processes and forwards signals: clean shutdowns. |
| Port on `127.0.0.1` | Nobody outside your machine reaches the panel unless you configure it (and then HTTPS is required). With `compose.prod.yaml` the API publishes no port at all: only Caddy reaches it. |
| Rotated logs (10 MB × 5) | Docker logs don't fill the disk. |

Engines are launched per scan as ephemeral containers (`--rm`) with the code mounted read-only, `--cap-drop ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, and a cap of 3 GB of memory, 2 CPUs and 512 processes; Gitleaks, Opengrep, Checkov and zizmor run with no network.

**The remaining trade-off:** to launch the engines this way, the worker mounts `/var/run/docker.sock`, which is equivalent to root on the host. That's why the panel only listens on `127.0.0.1` by default. The alternative is the worker image with the engines inside (`PITANGUS_ENGINE_RUNNER=local`): no socket, each engine a process of the worker with its own home folder and no inherited settings, but without a container per engine. The engines that need no network get an empty network namespace where the platform allows user namespaces (not in a container with Docker's default seccomp profile).

## Isolation between scans

Each scan uses its own snapshot of the repository (`data/work/snapshot-…/`, one per scan) and fresh engine containers that are destroyed when it finishes, so two scans never share files or processes. Each worker runs them **one at a time**, which keeps its resource use to one engine at a time; more workers run more scans ([scaling.md](scaling.md)).

We evaluated moving to an ephemeral *runner* per scan (a container with every tool, its own network and its own volume, destroyed at the end) and running several in parallel. It's an open line of work. The evaluation concluded that the direction is right, but the tools shouldn't be downloaded on every scan (slow, and a larger supply-chain surface); they should ship in a pinned image instead, and parallelism needs a configurable limit so it doesn't exhaust the machine.
