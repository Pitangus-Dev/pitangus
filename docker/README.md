# docker/

Image definitions. They are built from the repository root with `make build` (or `docker compose build`); you don't need to work in here.

| Folder | Image | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app/` | `localhost/pitangus/app:<version>` | Panel + API + scan queue. Multi-stage: Node only builds the panel. Base images pinned by digest, unprivileged user, OCI labels. |
| `engines/opengrep/` | `localhost/pitangus/opengrep:1.30.0` | SAST engine. Downloads the official binary and checks it against its SHA-256; if it doesn't match, the build fails. `VERIFY.md` explains the Cosign verification. |
| `caddy/` | `caddy` (official, pinned by digest) | Only its `Caddyfile`: the HTTPS reverse proxy of `compose.prod.yaml` (certificate, redirect, limits, timeouts). |

Both images are also published for amd64 and arm64 on every version tag (`ghcr.io/pitangus-dev/pitangus` and `…/pitangus-opengrep`, signed with cosign, with SBOM and provenance): `compose.images.yaml` uses them instead of building. See [docs/deploy-vps.md](../docs/deploy-vps.md).

The other engines (Trivy, OSV-Scanner, Gitleaks, Grype, Checkov, zizmor) aren't built: their official images are used, pinned by digest (see `pitangus/modules/scanning/engines.py`).

To upgrade an engine, change its version and digest (or SHA-256) in `pitangus/modules/scanning/engines.py` and in the matching Dockerfile; `tests/test_packaging.py` checks that compose and the code agree.
