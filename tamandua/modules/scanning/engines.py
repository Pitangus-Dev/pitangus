"""External scanners in containers pinned by digest, each covering one area.

- Trivy: dependencies of any ecosystem, infrastructure configuration
  (Dockerfile, Kubernetes, Terraform) and secrets. Needs network only to fetch its
  vulnerability database, which is cached; sends nothing from the repository.
- OSV-Scanner: dependencies against the OSV database (which includes Dependabot's GitHub
  Advisory Database) and more manifest formats (.NET, Gradle, uv…). Downloads the advisory
  databases and compares locally; what matches Trivy is merged into a single finding.
- Gitleaks: high-precision secrets. No network.
- Opengrep: multi-language SAST with our own rules (`rules/`). No network.
- Checkov and zizmor: infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipelines (`config_scanners`). No network.

Each container runs with no capabilities, no privilege escalation, the
snapshot mounted read-only and **with the same UID and GID as the app**: on Linux,
root without capabilities can't enter the app's 0700 folders and the engines
would return zero findings without warning (on macOS, Docker Desktop hides this). If Docker or an image is missing,
the step is declared `not_tested` with the reason: a run is never faked.

Secret values are never stored: only rule, file and line.
