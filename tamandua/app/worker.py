"""Worker process: runs the queued scans and the periodic tasks. It is the only one that needs Docker.

* Scans: claims jobs from the PostgreSQL queue (several workers can run at once).
* Periodic tasks (PR and main-branch watching, daily new advisories, NVD sync and the notification outbox): only
  one worker runs them, the one holding the leader lock in PostgreSQL. If that worker dies, its connection closes,
  the lock is released and another worker takes it.
